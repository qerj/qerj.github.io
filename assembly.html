        <p>We must all know that behind C there is a lower level known as assembly. Assembly makes machine instructions readable to the human eye.</p>
        <p>int i = 5; is equal to mov eax, ebx in assembly</p>
        <p>Lets take a jmp instruction for exmaple: jmp 0xA1343D04 which will jump to a address in memory</p>
        <p>A common debugger will show something like this E9 00 00 00 00 along side this jmp instruction</p>
        <p>that array of bytes is the lowest level youll ever get. This is why we use hex with memory and etc.</p>
        <p>Those bytes will convert to binary that then the CPU will finally process and be able to read it.</p>
        <P></P>
        <p>Thanks!</p>
